The Variety of Beja described in Almkvist1881. Replaces beja-bishari

Beja is a closely related group of language varieties and dialects spoken in the Red Sea coastal and hill regions in Sudan, Eritrea, and Egypt by more than a million individuals. The Northern-most representative of Beja is documented here, that of the Bishari in Aswan and Sudan, studied by Herman Almkvist (1881) in one of the earliest monographs dedicated to a variety of Beja.
